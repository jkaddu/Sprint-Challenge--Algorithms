#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)O(n)...its linear because as n increases the run time increases


b)O(n^3)...its exponential because the number of nested loops increases the complexity except for the last loop where n is constant.


c) O(n)...similar to a, as number of steps is increased as n increases.

## Exercise II

We can go about in a binary fashion and go to the middle floor and see where it breaks at. We'll say the middle floor is 4 and the egg breaks there. Then we'll test the next floor to see if it breaks and if it doesn't we can say everything to below the 4th floor or to the left of the array does not break the egg and everything above the 4th floor and to the right of thr array breaks the egg.
